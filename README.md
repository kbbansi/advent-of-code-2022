# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenge for 2022.

The chosen language is **Java**. 

For each solution, there will be a *brute force* implementation and then an optimized version of the solution.

## Goals

The goal here is not to complete AOC-2022, but rather to improve my **problem-solving** skill set.
